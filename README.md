lcore - event engine and sockets library for Delphi and free pascal
===================================================================

**This is an unofficial mirror of the lcore library.**
**The official repository with the latest release is here:** http://www.lcore.org/

This unofficial mirror exists purely to make it easier to compile other open source projects of mine on GitHub, they will be compiled against this version of the library. Occasionally I may mark a version as **stable**, meaning I am using that version to compile against for a project - however this is purely my own judgement.

If you want to build a program with lcore, please use the official repository to get the latest release. You are welcome to use this mirror as well if you wish, but it may be out of date (sometimes, severely so).

This is the original text taken from the official repository website, about this library:
```
There isn't really any documentation right now other than what is in the source
