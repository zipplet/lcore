lcore - event engine and sockets library for Delphi and free pascal
===================================================================

**This is an unofficial mirror of the lcore library.**
**The official repository with the latest release is here:** http://www.lcore.org/

This unofficial mirror exists purely to make it easier to compile other open source projects of mine on GitHub, they will be compiled against this version of the library. Occasionally I may mark a version as **stable**.

If you want to build a program with lcore, please use the official repository to get the latest release.

This is the original text taken from the official repository website, about this library:
```
There isn't really any documentation right now other than what is in the source
